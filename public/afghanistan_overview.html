                        <p>Afghanistan is bounded on the north by Turkmenistan (744km), Uzbekistan (137km) and Tajikistan (1206km), on the northeast by China(96km), on the south and east by Pakistan (2412km) and on the west by Iran (925km).</p>
                        <p>The country’s area is 653000 sq. km. The Settled population in 2003-2004 according to CSO Estimated Population of Afghanistan Gazetteer amounted almost (20691400).</p>

                        <p>Agriculture is the main branch of the country’s economy, it employs nearly 85 per cent of the population and produces about two-thirds of the national income. Land cultivation is concentrated in oases and valleys, and live-stock breeding has a semi-nomadic character.</p>
                        <p>Irrigated lands yield a major portion of the country’s crop production. Half of the improved lands, however, still suffer from a shortage of water. The construction of the present irrigation systems in Afghanistan began after 1945, but only one – the Jalalabad system – is effective from an economic point of view.</p>
                        <p>The country’s main crop is wheat, Corn and rice.
                        Livestock breeding is a major branch of agriculture; it accounts for almost 30 percent of agricultural production.</p>

                        <p>Mountains dominate the central and eastern part of Afghanistan, covering about three-fourths of the country. The huge mountain system of the Hindukush with its highest peak Naw Shakh (7485m) stretches from the northeast to the southwest, where it borders with the Kohi Baba, Feroz Koh, Terbandi Turkistan and some smaller ranges, surrounded by a belt of deserts. In the northeastern outskirts Hindukush borders with the plateau of Pamir, and the range of Karakorum. Deserts cover the southern and western parts of the country.</p>
                        <p>A loess plateau, sloping towards the north, covers the northern part of the country; it borders with the outskirts of the huge desert Kara Kum where the lowest point of Afghanistan (259m) is situated.
                        The geological structure of the mountains is very complex; both Paleozoic rocks (granites, genisses) as well as Jurassic, Cretaceous and Tertiary (lime stones, sandstone) deposits have been identified there.</p>
                        <p>The sources of most rivers lie in the mountains. The level of water in the rivers oscillates greatly. The highest level is in spring and early summer. In the remaining seasons the rivers may change into small streams or entirely disappear.</p>
                        <p>The largest river flowing from the spring to the mouth of Afghanistan’s territory is the Hilmand River. The border river Amudarya is one of the most important rivers in Central Asia.</p>
                        <p>Afghanistan has mainly a dry , continental climate. The amplitude of temperature between day and night is very large. The great variety of terrain elevation results in different climatic types.</p>
