                        <p>Afghanistan is currently undergoing radical change as government 
                            reforms and seeks to establish effective line ministries and

                            skills of the AIMS staff enable them to comment on a wide variety of 
                            topics, with a clarity and expertise rarely found in similar environments. 
                            Many of the requests involve semi-technical questions regarding the 
                            nature of mapping, data collection and GIS in Afghanistan. Most clients 
                            are unfamiliar with the special problems of geographic and demographic
